This is the gh-pages of a react personal project, as for now (january 18th of 2024), it doesn't open properly because of some malfunctioning of router link and github pages, therefore the github pages host doesn't work properly, even I wa sent an email of warning informing caution of phishing, I'll see how to fix this problem. i checked other projects as well, thank God they're working well, this README is only t inform of this issues to anyone that looks at this repository.
